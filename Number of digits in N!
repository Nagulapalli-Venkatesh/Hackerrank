#PROBLEM
Number of digits in N!
As simple as the title, given a number N, print the number of digits in N!
N! is defined as : N! = 1*2*3...(N-1)*N
0! = 0 and 1! = 1.
No number ever contains any leading zeros.

Input Format
Input contains only one number, N.
Output Format
Output one number that is equal to the number of digits in N!

Explanation 0
6! = 1x2x3x4x5x6 = 720 which has 3 digits. So the answer is 3.

#SOLUTION
import math
n=int(input())
print(len(str(math.factorial(n))))
