#PRIBLEM
The Imperial Sum of an Array is defined as the maximum possible sum of a subsequence that can be obtained from an array with the constraint that no 2 elements in the chosen subsequence should be adjacent to each other in the given array.

Your task is given an array that does not contain any zeros or negative numbers, find its Imperial Sum.

Input Format
First line contains the size of the array N.
Second line contains N space separated positive integers denoting the elements of the array A[N].
Output Format
Output one number that is equal to the Imperial Sum of the Array.

#SOLUTION
n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int,input().split()))
incl,excl=0,0
for i in arr: 
    new_excl = excl if excl>incl else incl 
    incl = excl + i
    excl = new_excl 
print(excl if excl>incl else incl)
