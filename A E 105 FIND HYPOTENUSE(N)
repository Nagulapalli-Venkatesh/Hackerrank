Write a program to calculate the hypotenuse of the right angled triangle where the two sides of a triangle S1, S2 are given as input.Print the output to the stdout in floating point format with exactly 2 decimal precession other the floating point number,no other extra information should be printed.
Example:
Given inputs 10 and 20 , here S1=10 and S2=20 and the expected output = 22.36
Input Format
Two integers denoting the length of the sides S1,S2

SOLUTION

from math import sqrt
a = float(input())
b = float(input())
c = sqrt(a**2 + b**2)
print("%.2f" %c)
