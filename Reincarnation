#PROBLEM
In the world of numbers every number dies at some point and reincarnates. The newer generation will always surpass the previous generation 
and hence every number X upon incarnation will be promoted with a power Y i.e. X will now become X raised to the power Y. The god of the 
world of numbers needs a small break and hence has given you the task of reincarnating the incoming numbers after raising them to the power Y.

Input Format
Two numbers, X and Y.
Output Format
One number, X raised to the power Y.

#SOLUTION
x,y = map(int,input().split())
print(pow(x,y))
