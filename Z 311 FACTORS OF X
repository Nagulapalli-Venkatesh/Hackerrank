#PROBLEM
One day a teacher gave an assignment to the student to find the factors of a number. The student is not intrested to do the given 
task and he was searching for the shortcuts. So, please help him by writing a program

Input Format
First line contains an integer T denoting the no.of testcases.
The next T lines contains integers whose factors we have to determine
Output Format
Factors of number seperated by a space in the new line

#SOLUTION
def print_factors(x):
    factors=[]
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
    return factors
        
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    x = int(input())
    y = print_factors(x)
    print(*y)

OR

t=int(input())
a=[]
for i in range(1,t+1):
    x=int(input())
    a.append(x)
for i in a:
    for j in range(1,i+1):
        if(i%j==0):
            print(j,end=" ")
    print()
