#PROBLEM
Z 403 Sum of all Digits
You are given an integer I in the following format :
You are given two integers P and Q.
Integer I can be obtained by appending Q instances of P together.
For example, if P = 619 and Q = 4, then I = 619619619619.

Your task is, given P and Q find the sum of all the digits of I.
That sounds too simple, so lets take it up a notch.
Lets say the sum of all digits is S, then run the following pseudocode :

int SumOfDigits(S) :
	K <- Sum of Digits of S
    if K is a single digit number, return K
    else return SumOfDigits(K)
    
INPUT
Input consist of two numbers P and Q separated by a space.
OUTPUT
Print a single digit, the final digit when the numbers of I are continuously added.

Sample Input 0
148 3
Sample Output 0
3

#SOLUTION
p,q=map(int,input().split())
print(1+(q*sum(int(x) for x in str(p))-1) % 9)
